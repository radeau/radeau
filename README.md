# 👋 Welcome to my little corner here!

Hi, I'm **Kevin** -a freelance developer and automation specialist focused on **workflow automation** and **process optimization**. My mission is to leverage both **low-code/no-code platforms** and **custom development** to build scalable, efficient, and human-centered solutions.

I believe automation should do more than save time. It should **eliminate friction, enhance collaboration, and unlock innovation**.
-   🚀 Currently building **automated workflows** across platforms like **Power Automate, n8n, Make (Integromat), Zapier, and Airtable**.
-   🌱 Expanding expertise in **API integrations** and **hybrid automations** that bridge low-code tools with custom code.
-   🛠 Background in **full-stack web development** (C, JavaScript, React, Node.js) enables me to go beyond platform limitations when required.
-   💡 Fun fact: I see automation as the “glue” between technology and people-the hidden layer that makes everything work seamlessly.
